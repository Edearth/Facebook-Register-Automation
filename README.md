# Facebook Register Automation

This small project automates the first step of Facebook register. It does so using Selenium. It uses Boni Garcia's ["Web Driver Manager"](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) to download the WebDriver to ensure we can build it just with Gradle.

### How to execute the test

Just run `gradle clean test` on the project's root.
